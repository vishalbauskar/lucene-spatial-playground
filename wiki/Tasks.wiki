= Testing =
 * Test CircleImpl thoroughly, especially intersection
 * ~~Port old geohash SOLR-2155 extensive test~~
 * ~~Test sorting~~
 * Test indexing shapes

= Framework Rework/Refactor =
 * SpatialContext should not be a singleton; tie to a field.
 * SpatialContext (with units, calculator, and world bounds) and the prefix trie impl, should be configurable in a Solr field type.
 * distPrec of query should default to that configured on the field.  And add localParams lookup?

= Features =
 * ~~Use needScore local-param for use of Filter vs. ValueSource~~
  * Demonstrate score-sorted order in README, demo app
 * Port & hack geodist() query parser for compatibility with LSP
 * Implement proper polygon world-wrap & pole-wrap. Look elsewhere for ideas
 * *Benchmarking!*

= Misc =
 * ~~Investigate how R-Trees differ from the RecursivePrefixFilter.~~ -- not same!
  * Find prior-art for Trie implementation of spatial (point, and shape/area too).
 * Are there things we need to do to be more compatible with [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards OGC]?
