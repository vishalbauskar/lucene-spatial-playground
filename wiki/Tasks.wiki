= Testing =
 * Test CircleImpl thoroughly, especially intersection
 * Port old geohash SOLR-2155 extensive test
 * Test sorting
 * Test indexing shapes

= Framework =
 * SpatialContext should not be a singleton; tie to a field

= Features =
 * Use needScore local-param for use of Filter vs. ValueSource
 ** Demonstrate score-sorted order in README, demo app
 * Port & hack geodist() query parser for compatibility with LSP
 * Implement proper polygon world-wrap & pole-wrap. Look elsewhere for ideas
 * *Benchmarking!*

= Misc =
 * Investigate how R-Trees differ from the RecursivePrefixFilter.
 * Are there things we need to do to be more compatible with [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards OGC]?
