Playground to try spatial indexing approaches

# This project is now known as Spatial4J #
The project formerly known as LSP is now named Spatial4J.  That is half the story.  At least half of LSP had nothing to do with Lucene and Solr.  This half is a general purpose geospatial library largely centered around a set of shapes and related input/output and distance calculations.  It is this piece that is named Spatial4J.  The Apache Lucene / Solr geospatial indexing portions are [in the process](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3795) of being migrated into Lucene and Solr core.

# Spatial4J moved #
Spatial4J lives at http://spatial4j.com aliased to a GitHub project.
